## Transcribed Questions

### 1.1.1
Show that the number $\sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{3}$ is algebraic

### 1.2.1
Show that $f: N \times N \rightarrow N$ defined by $f(m,n) = 2^{m-1}(2n-1)$ is a bijective function

### 1.2.2
Create an injective map $f: \mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and show that your creation is injective

### 1.2.3
Show that the algebraic numbers are countable by making use of the following:
- For a polynomial of degree $n$ with integer coefficients, $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$, explain without proof the cardinality of the set $\{a \| p(a) = 0\}$.
- Create a surjection from $\mathbb{Z}^{n+1} \times \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ to zeroes of any nth degree integer coefficient polynomial. Explain why $\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}\times{1, 2, \dots , n}$ is countable by quoting theorems in this section.
- Explain why the set of algebraic numbers is countable using the prior part and quoting a theorem in this section.

### 1.2.4
Show that if a countable subset is removed from an uncountable set, the remainder is still uncountable

### 1.3.1
Prove that if $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $a + b > 0$

### 1.3.2
Prove proposition 129. The axioms for multiplication imply the following:
- If $x \neq 0$ and $xy = xz$, then $y = z$
- If $x \neq 0$ and $xy = x$, then $y = 1$
- If $x \neq 0$ and $xy = 1$, then $y = \frac1x$
- If $x \neq 0$, then $x = \frac{1}{\frac1x}$

### 1.4.1
Prove $||x| - |y|| \leq |x - y|$
